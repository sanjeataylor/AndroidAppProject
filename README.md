# Stock Outline

## Project Description
StockCheck is an Android mobile application designed to provide accurate, real-time inventory management.  
It aims to solve the common problem of mismatched recorded against actual inventory for businesses of all sizes, including retail stores, warehouses, distribution centers, and small businesses.

## Problem Addressing
The main problem our app addresses is:  
- Businesses often find that recorded stock levels do not match what is physically available — “it says we have it, but we don’t.”  
- This can lead to lost revenue, excess inventory, labor waste, operational mistakes, and dissatisfied employees or customers.  
- Small businesses, retailers, warehouses, distribution centers, and their employees/managers are affected.  

By solving this problem, StockCheck will provide real-time tracking, automated discrepancy notifications, and cloud-based syncing, helping businesses reduce financial losses, improve efficiency, and make better inventory decisions.

## Platform
The app will be developed for:  
- Android mobile devices 
- Windows Desktop 
- Reason for platform choice: Android allows on-the-floor inventory management and barcode scanning, while desktop provides a detailed view for managers and reporting. This combination balances mobility and administrative flexibility.

## Front-End / Back-End Support
Front-End:
- Flutter, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout, styling, and interactivity  
- Features include quick QR/barcode scanning, real-time dashboards, and inventory listings  

Back-End: 
- Firebase Cloud Database for real-time synchronization  
- APIs connect the front-end to the database, analytics tools, and automated alerts  
- Secure cloud storage keeps track of past records, reports, and user activity logs

- User login system with manager-controlled access
